You are now out of stickers :(

NOTE: DO NOT put this on property that isn't yours. Don't be THAT furry.

These are paper stickers and they're annoying to remove. Use isopropyl alcohol, WD-40, or Goo-Gone to make it easier.

Too much heat will turn these black. These will start fading in a few years and will fade faster in direct sunlight or with constant gentle friction.

Have a good con!
