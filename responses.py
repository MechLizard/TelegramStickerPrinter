You are now out of stickers :(

NOTE: DO NOT put these on property that isn't yours.

These are paper stickers and they're annoying to remove. Use isopropyl alcohol, WD-40, or Goo-Gone to make it easier.

Too much heat will turn these black. Will start fading in a few years and will fade faster in direct sunlight or with frequent friction.

Have a good con!
